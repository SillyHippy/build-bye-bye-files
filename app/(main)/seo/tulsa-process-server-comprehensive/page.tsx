                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What exactly does a process server do?</h3>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">A process server is a professional who delivers legal documents (like lawsuits, subpoenas, and restraining orders) to individuals involved in a court case. This official notification, called "service of process," is legally required to ensure the individual is aware of the legal action against them, upholding their right to due process.</p>

                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">How much does it cost to hire a process server in Tulsa?</h3>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">The cost varies based on urgency. Standard service in the Tulsa metro area starts at a competitive rate, while rush and same-day services are available for time-sensitive cases. We provide a full, transparent quote upfront with no hidden fees. Please see our <a href="/pricing" className="text-blue-600 underline">pricing page</a> for details.</p>

                        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">Our experienced process servers are trained in various techniques to handle evasive subjects. If direct personal service is not possible after multiple attempts, we can perform a "substitute service" as allowed by Oklahoma law, which may involve leaving the documents with a competent person at the residence or workplace and mailing a copy. We document all attempts meticulously.</p>

Every service is performed in strict compliance with the Oklahoma Rules of Civil Procedure, and we provide a notarized Affidavit of Service that is ready for filing with the Tulsa County court clerk.</p>
